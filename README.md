<h1>RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
<p>

The Railway Management System, also known as RailX, was developed during my 6th semester in college as part of the Software Project Management (SPM) course. Despite being a mini-project, RailX was equipped with email capabilities, enabling users to receive their tickets via email upon booking. Additionally, it offers both web-based and database-driven functionalities, allowing users to access the system either through a website with a database backend or by utilizing preset configurations that utilize randomization to display train schedules.
